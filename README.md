## Meter Types

There are currently 3 different meters available in the 1.12 version.

### **FE Meter**
Works with all implementations of Forge Energy:

- Redstone Flux (RF) - *from various mods, including the [Thermal series](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-foundation)*
- Micro Infinities (Î¼I) - *from [Ender IO](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ender-io)*
- Immersive Flux (IF) - *from [Immersive Engineering](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering)*

### **MJ Meter**
Works with:

- Minecraft Joule (MJ) - *from [BuildCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/buildcraft)*

Only available if BuildCraft is installed, of course.

### **EU Meter**
Works with:

- Energy Unit (EU) - *from [IndustrialCraft 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-craft)*

Only available if IC2 is installed, of course. When using the Classic profile, the recipe uses _Refined Iron_ instead of _Iron Plates_.

Due to the way the IC2 EU system works, you cannot set a limit on EU meters.

## ComputerCraft and OpenComputers Integration
Energy meters expose a Lua API that can be used by ComputerCraft and OpenComputers. For the full API documentation, see [this wiki page](https://github.com/vladmarica/energy-meters/wiki/Lua-API).
